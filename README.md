I'm useing netbeans if we're doing this thing in JS. It's also working with github but it's likely you could get VS to work too.

You can get NetBeans here(HTML 5 and PHP vertion is fine): https://netbeans.org/downloads/

## Seting up for Github
You'll want to register an account and fork this repository, from there you can change whatever you want and later make a pull request to merge it back into this repo. Once you have you're own repo you'll want to get your IDE setup to make changes to it.
