# ITPA-Game
I'm using NetBeans if we're doing this thing in JS. NetBeans works with GitHub but if you find another IDE that works for you feel free to use it.

You can get NetBeans here(HTML 5 and PHP version is fine): https://netbeans.org/downloads/

Feel free to make changes to this readme and pull them. Though I will police what is changed to keep it useable.

## Setting up for Github
You'll want to register an account and fork this repository to create your own copy of the code. Once you have you're own repository you'll want to get your IDE setup to make changes to it.

NetBeans GIT tutorials:

## How to use GitHub
The basic idea is you would fork this repository to get a separate copy that only you can change. Once you've done whatever it is you want changed you can make a pull request to merge your fork back into this master copy and github will show me a what was changed. If I approve what is changed (and this is just gona be some random site so unless you break everything I likely will) Github will cleanly merge your new code even if other things have been changed to the master branch while you were working.

TL;DR: We don't need to work in the same room for this to not become a clusterfuck.
