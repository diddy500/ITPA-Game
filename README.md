# ITPA-Game
I'm using NetBeans if we're doing this thing in JS. NetBeans works with GitHub but if you find another IDE that works for you feel free to use it, just make sure it can play nice with what everyone else is using.

Feel free to make changes to this readme and pull them. I will policing what is changed to keep it useable.

## How to use GitHub
1. Make an account
2. Fork this repositry (button top right)
3. Clone your repo down to your local machine with NetBeans/other 
4. Make changes to the local copy and then commit and push them up to your repo on GitHub
5. Make a pull request to merge your fork back into the master copy
6. Wait for me to approve it (unless you've done something terrible I will)
7. Start again at 2

## Why use GitHub
The basic idea is you would fork this repository to get a separate copy that only you can change. Once you've done whatever it is you want changed you can make a pull request to merge your fork back into this master copy and github will show me a breakdown of what lines of code were changed/added/deleted. If I approve what is pull request Github will cleanly merge your new code even if other things have been changed to the master branch while you were working.

TL;DR: We don't need to work in the same room for this to not become a clusterfuck.
